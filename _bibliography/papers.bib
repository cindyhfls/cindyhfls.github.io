	abstract = {Abstract
            Neurofilament light chain, a putative measure of neuronal damage, is measurable in blood and CSF and is predictive of cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. There has been limited prior work linking neurofilament light and functional connectivity, and no prior work has investigated neurofilament light associations with functional connectivity in autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we assessed relationships between blood neurofilament light, cognition, and functional connectivity in a cross-sectional sample of 106 autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease mutation carriers and 76 non-carriers. We employed an innovative network-level enrichment analysis approach to assess connectome-wide associations with neurofilament light.
            Neurofilament light was positively correlated with deterioration of functional connectivity within the default mode network and negatively correlated with connectivity between default mode network and executive control networks, including the cingulo-opercular, salience, and dorsal attention networks. Further, reduced connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and executive control networks was associated with reduced cognitive function. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that neurofilament levels and functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network explained significant variance in cognitive composite scores when controlling for age, sex, and education. A mediation analysis demonstrated that functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and dorsal attention network partially mediated the relationship between blood neurofilament light levels and cognitive function.
            Our novel results indicate that blood estimates of neurofilament levels correspond to direct measurements of brain dysfunction, shedding new light on the underlying biological processes of Alzheimer’s disease. Further, we demonstrate how variation within key brain systems can partially mediate the negative effects of heightened total serum neurofilament levels, suggesting potential regions for targeted interventions. Finally, our results lend further evidence that low-cost and minimally invasive blood measurements of neurofilament may be a useful marker of brain functional connectivity and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Successful pursuit and evasion require rapid and precise coordination of navigation with adaptive motor control. We hypothesize that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which communicates bidirectionally with both the hippocampal complex and premotor/motor areas, would serve a mapping role in this process. We recorded responses of dACC ensembles in two macaques performing a joystick-controlled continuous pursuit/evasion task. We find that dACC carries two sets of signals, (1) world-centric variables that together form a representation of the position and velocity of all relevant agents (self, prey, and predator) in the virtual world, and (2) avatar-centric variables, i.e. self-prey distance and angle. Both sets of variables are multiplexed within an overlapping set of neurons. Our results suggest that dACC may contribute to pursuit and evasion by computing and continuously updating a multicentric representation of the unfolding task state, and support the hypothesis that it plays a high-level abstract role in the control of behavior.},

Such parcellations of the cortex have been derived in adults and older infants, but there is no widely used surface parcellation available for the neonatal brain. Here, we first demonstrate that existing parcellations, including surface-based parcels derived from older samples as well as volume-based neonatal parcels, are a poor fit for neonatal surface data. We next derive a set of 283 cortical surface parcels from a sample of n = 261 neonates. These parcels have highly homogenous FC patterns and are validated using three external neonatal datasets. The Infomap algorithm is used to assign functional network identities to each parcel, and derived networks are consistent with prior work in neonates. The proposed parcellation may represent neonatal cortical areas and provides a powerful tool for neonatal neuroimaging studies.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized to identify brain connectivity biomarkers linked to behavioral and clinical outcomes. However, research often prioritizes prediction accuracy at the expense of biological interpretability, and inconsistent implementation of ML methods may hinder model accuracy. To address this, our paper introduces a network-level enrichment approach, which integrates brain system organization in the context of connectome-wide statistical analysis to reveal network-level links between brain connectivity and behavior. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we used linear support vector regression (LSVR) models to examine the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity networks and chronological age. We compared network-level associations based on raw LSVR weights to those produced from the forward and inverse models. Results indicated that not accounting for shared family variance inflated prediction performance, the k-best feature selection via Pearson correlation reduced accuracy and reliability, and raw LSVR model weights produced network-level associations that deviated from the significant brain systems identified by forward and inverse models. Our findings offer crucial insights for applying machine learning to neuroimaging data, emphasizing the value of network enrichment for biological interpretation.},

Likewise, spatial correlation is assessed across average functional connectivity profiles of groups to evaluate the maturity of functional networks during development. Despite its widespread use, spatial correlation is limited to comparing two samples at a time. In this study, we employed a variational autoencoder to embed functional connectivity profiles from various anatomical locations, individuals, and group averages for simultaneous comparison. We demonstrate that our variational autoencoder, with pre-trained weights, can project new functional connectivity profiles from the vertex space to a latent space with as few as two dimensions, yet still retain meaningful global and local structures in the data. Functional connectivity profiles from various functional networks occupy distinct compartments of the latent space. Moreover, the variability of functional connectivity profiles from the same anatomical location is readily captured in the latent space. We believe that this approach could be useful for visualization and exploratory analyses in precision functional mapping.},
